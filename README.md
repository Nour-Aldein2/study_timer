<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><h1>Study Timer App</h1><p>This is a simple countdown timer app that allows users to set a timer for a specific duration (in hours and minutes). Once the timer starts, it counts down the time and stops when it reaches zero. The app also plays a bell sound at the end of the countdown.</p><p>The app has a "focus mode" feature that helps users stay focused during the study time. When the timer starts, the app sends an AppleScript command to turn on the "Do Not Disturb" mode on the computer, and it turns off after the timer stops.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>To run this app, you need to have Python 3 and the following packages installed:</p><ul><li>tkinter</li><li>ttk</li><li>ttkthemes</li><li>sv_ttk</li><li>pygame</li></ul><h2>How to use the app</h2><ol><li><p>Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code files.</p></li><li><p>Run the following command to start the app:</p><pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs">python study_timer.py
